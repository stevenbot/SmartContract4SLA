# SmartContract4SLA

The source code is in the file "SmartContracts4SLA.sol" of this repository. It contains two types of smart contract. One is the *witness-pool* smart contract, which is the basic one for witness management. The other is a *specific SLA* smart contract, which is generated by the witness-pool smart contract. Follwing JSON files in this repository are used for interacting with a deployed smart contract, if contract address is known. 

- "WitnessPoolInterfaces.json" is the description file of the witness-pool smart contract interfaces. 

- "CloudSLAInterfaces.json" is the description file of the specific SLA smart contract interfaces.   

For the detailed model design and implementation, you can check reports as follows.
